# AGS Lockscreen

This is my lockscreen written using `AGS` and the `gtk-session-lock` library.

I made this because the font rendering for hyprlock was really bad and I didn't want to configure it. This is probably really jank but it works for my needs.

## Notes

- I have not tested this with multiple monitors. In theory, it _should work_ as I followed _most_ instructions.
